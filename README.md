# Online-Bookstore

This is a full stack application with a lot of features. I developed an online store using Java Spring for backend and React for frontend.  
  
- Backend features
  
   - admin side
      - add/edit/remove a book
      - see how many customers are logged to their accounts on that moment
        
   - client side                                                                                                                 
      - the client can create/edit/remove an account
      - product reviews added by clients
      - placing an order
      - the customer receives cumulative points after each order
      - can switch between english and romanian languages
      - creating and editing a list of favorite products
      - every time when a book from client's favorite list is back to stock, the customer is notified
      - the client can add or delete products from his cart 
      - sort the products in ascending or descending order according to price
      - filter the products by its category: thriller, economy or young adult
      - the client gets a confirmation message on its personal mail after creating a new account
      - the customer can place an order or leave a review of a product only if he is registered. Otherwise he can only see the books
    
    There are more other small funnctionalities like inputs checking (email has to respect the pattern ..@gmail/yahoo/etc.com), pages navigation
